**Secure. Split. Share.**

seQRets is a hyper-secure, open-source application designed to protect your most sensitive digital information — from crypto seed phrases and private keys to passwords and other confidential data. It uses **Shamir's Secret Sharing** to split your secret into multiple QR codes called **Qards**.

To restore your original secret, you must bring a specific number of these Qards back together. This eliminates the single point of failure associated with storing secrets in one location, providing a robust solution for personal backup and cryptocurrency inheritance planning. Everything runs locally — your secrets are never transmitted to any server.

> 🛡️ **Your secrets never leave your device.** All encryption, splitting, and decryption happens entirely in your browser (web) or on your machine (desktop). No servers, no cloud, no accounts, no telemetry. seQRets is [open source](https://github.com/jalapeno4332/seQRets) — audit every line.

> **v1.0.1 🔥 Ignition** — Available as a web app (Next.js) and native desktop app (Tauri + Vite).

## ⚠️ Warning

**Your security is your responsibility.** seQRets gives you full control over your digital assets. Misplacing your password or the required number of Qards can result in the **permanent loss** of your secret. The developers have no access to your data, cannot recover your password, and cannot restore your secrets. Manage your Qards and password with extreme care.

## 🤔 Why Not Just Encrypt a USB Drive?

Encrypting a USB drive is better than nothing — but it has critical weaknesses that seQRets solves:

| | Encrypted USB Drive | seQRets (Shamir's Secret Sharing) |
|---|---|---|
| **Single point of failure** | Drive lost, damaged, or stolen = everything gone | Split across multiple Qards — survive the loss of any piece |
| **One password = full access** | Anyone with the password gets everything | Need the threshold of Qards AND the password — layered defense |
| **Inheritance** | Must trust one person with the drive + password | Distribute Qards to multiple people/locations — no single person has full access |
| **Disaster resilience** | One fire, flood, or theft can destroy the only copy | Qards distributed across locations survive localized disasters |
| **Stolen share** | N/A — it's all-or-nothing | A single Qard is indistinguishable from random noise without the other Qards + password |

**The core insight:** seQRets doesn't just encrypt your secret — it *eliminates single points of failure* by splitting the encrypted data so that no single person, location, or device holds enough to compromise it.

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Secure Your Secret
- Enter any text-based secret (seed phrases, private keys, passwords, etc.)
- Encrypt with a strong password (24+ characters required)
- Optionally add a **keyfile** as a second factor — both password AND keyfile are required for recovery; generate a keyfile and **download** or **save to Smart Card** (desktop only)
- **Keyfile smart card storage** — write keyfiles to JavaCard for tamper-resistant physical backup; load keyfiles from a smart card anywhere keyfiles are accepted (desktop only)
- Split into configurable Qards (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5 threshold)
- Download Qards as QR code images or export as a `.seqrets` vault file
- **Write to JavaCard smartcard** — store individual shares, full vaults, keyfiles, or encrypted inheritance plans on JCOP3 hardware (desktop only)
- **100% offline-capable** — works without an internet connection. No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry. The only optional network call is the Bob AI assistant (user-provided API key).

- **Seed Phrase Generator** — generate valid BIP-39 mnemonic phrases
- **Bitcoin Ticker** — live BTC/USD price display
- **Bob AI Assistant** — Google Gemini-powered AI for setup guidance and questions (optional, user-provided API key). Can be disconnected at any time by removing the API key from within the chat interface.

### 🧬 BIP-39 Optimization
Seed phrases are automatically detected and converted to compact binary entropy before encryption. A 24-word phrase (~150 characters) becomes just 32 bytes, dramatically reducing QR code size.

## 🔐 Security Architecture

All cryptographic operations run **entirely on your device**. Your secrets never leave your machine.

| Layer | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Key Derivation** | Argon2id (64MB memory, 3 iterations, 32-byte key output) | Derive encryption key from password + optional keyfile |
| **Encryption** | XChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD) | Authenticated encryption with integrity verification |
| **Salt** | 16 random bytes (per operation) | Unique salt for each encryption — ensures distinct keys even with the same password |
| **Nonce** | 24 random bytes | Per-encryption nonce for XChaCha20 |
| **Splitting** | Shamir's Secret Sharing | Threshold-based secret splitting into Qards |
| **Compression** | Gzip (level 9) | Reduce payload size before encryption |
| **RNG** | OS-backed CSPRNG | **Desktop:** Rust `rand::thread_rng()` (OS entropy) for salts/nonces; `crypto.getRandomValues()` for passwords/keyfiles. **Web:** `crypto.getRandomValues()` for all operations. |
| **Memory** | Key zeroization | **Desktop:** Rust `zeroize` crate — compiler-fence guaranteed, optimizer-proof. Keys never cross the JS/Rust boundary. **Web:** `fill(0)` in `finally` blocks. Note: JS strings (passwords) cannot be zeroed — a browser/JS limitation. |

### 🔗 Encrypt-First Architecture (Security by Design)

seQRets deliberately **encrypts first, then splits** — this ordering is a critical security choice:

```
Secret → Compress (gzip) → Encrypt (XChaCha20-Poly1305) → Split (Shamir's) → Distribute
```

Each Qard contains a fragment of the **encrypted** ciphertext — never raw plaintext. To recover the secret, an attacker must:

1. **Obtain** the required threshold of Qards (e.g., 2-of-3), AND
2. **Know** the password (+ keyfile, if used)

These are **layered defenses** — both must be defeated. The alternative design (split first, then encrypt each share individually) is weaker: each share becomes an independent encryption target, and cracking the password on a single share could reveal partial plaintext. With Encrypt→Split, a stolen Qard is computationally indistinguishable from random noise.

### ⚛️ Quantum Resistance

The built-in password generator produces passwords with ~10^62 possible combinations. Even with Grover's algorithm (optimal quantum speedup), brute-forcing would take:

- **Optimistic estimate:** ~2 × 10^18 years (148 million × the age of the universe)
- **Realistic estimate:** ~2 × 10^23 years (148 trillion × the age of the universe)

Argon2id's memory-hardness provides additional quantum resistance, and XChaCha20-Poly1305 maintains 128-bit effective quantum security as a defense-in-depth layer.

### 🎲 Random Number Generation (CSPRNG)

All randomness in seQRets is sourced from a **Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG)** — the Web Crypto API's `crypto.getRandomValues()`, which draws from the operating system's entropy pool (`/dev/urandom` on Linux/macOS, `BCryptGenRandom` on Windows).

| Operation | Entropy | Method |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Seed phrase (12 words)** | 128 bits | `@scure/bip39` → `@noble/hashes randomBytes()` → `crypto.getRandomValues()` |
| **Seed phrase (24 words)** | 256 bits | `@scure/bip39` → `@noble/hashes randomBytes()` → `crypto.getRandomValues()` |
| **Password generation** | 32 × 32-bit values | `window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint32Array(32))` mapped to 88-char charset |
| **Keyfile generation** | 256 bits | `window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))` |
| **Encryption salt** | 128 bits (16 bytes) | Desktop: Rust `rand::thread_rng()` → OS entropy; Web: `@noble/hashes randomBytes()` → `crypto.getRandomValues()` |
| **Encryption nonce** | 192 bits (24 bytes) | Desktop: Rust `rand::thread_rng()` → OS entropy; Web: `@noble/hashes randomBytes()` → `crypto.getRandomValues()` |

No `Math.random()` or any other weak PRNG is used for any security-critical operation.

## 💳 JavaCard Smartcard Support

The desktop app supports storing Shamir shares, encrypted vaults, and encrypted inheritance plans on **JCOP3 JavaCard smartcards** (e.g., J3H145), providing tamper-resistant physical backups that survive fire, water, and digital threats.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Card:** JCOP3 J3H145 or compatible JavaCard 3.0.4+ smartcard (~110 KB usable EEPROM)
- **Reader:** Any PC/SC-compatible USB smart card reader

### Features
- **Write individual shares**, **full vaults**, **keyfiles**, or **encrypted inheritance plans** to a card via APDU over PC/SC
- **Read back** shares, vaults, or keyfiles directly from a card into the restore workflow
- **Multi-item storage** — store multiple items (shares, vaults, keyfiles, instructions) on a single card up to ~8 KB; new writes append to existing data
- **Per-item management** — view, select, and delete individual items from the Smart Card Manager page
- **Optional PIN protection** (8-16 characters) — card locks after 5 wrong attempts
- **PIN retry countdown** — real-time display of remaining PIN attempts (color-coded: gray → amber → red) across both the Smart Card Manager page and the smart card dialog
- **Generate PIN** — CSPRNG-powered 16-character PIN generator (upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols) with copy-to-clipboard and reveal/hide toggle
- **Data chunking** — automatically handles payloads larger than the 240-byte APDU limit
- **Erase** confirmation to prevent accidental data loss

### Applet Installation

The SeQRets JavaCard applet must be installed on each card before use. All build tools (`ant-javacard.jar`, `gp.jar`, and the JavaCard 3.0.4 SDK) are included in the repository — no additional downloads are needed.

**Requirements:** JDK 11–17 and Apache Ant.

```bash
cd packages/javacard

# Install JDK and Ant (macOS — skip if already installed)
brew install openjdk@11 ant

# Build the applet
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
ant clean build

# Install on card (card must be inserted in a PC/SC reader)
java -jar lib/gp.jar --install build/SeQRetsApplet.cap

# Verify installation
java -jar lib/gp.jar --list
```

> **Note:** Any JDK from version 11 through 17 will work. JDK 18+ is not supported by the JavaCard build toolchain. On macOS with Homebrew, you can also use `openjdk@17`.

## 💡 How It Works

### 📜 Encrypting an Inheritance Plan

**Option A — Upload a File (Encrypt Plan tab)**
1. **Upload** a document with instructions for your heirs (PDF, DOCX, ODT, TXT — up to 5MB)
2. **Set** a strong password (use the same password as your Qards, or generate a new one)
3. **Encrypt** — the file is encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305
4. **Save** — choose **Save to File** and/or **Write to Smart Card** (desktop only, for files under 8 KB)

**Option B — Build In-App (Create Plan tab, desktop only)**
1. **Fill out** the structured 7-section form: plan info, recovery credentials, Qard locations, digital assets, restoration steps, professional contacts, and a personal message
2. **Set** a strong password and optional keyfile
3. **Encrypt** — the plan is serialized as compact JSON (~2-4 KB) and encrypted
4. **Save** — saved with a dynamic filename based on the preparer's last name (e.g., `Smith-Inheritance-Plan.json`) and/or written to a smart card

To decrypt, go to the **Decrypt Plan** tab, upload the encrypted `.json` file or **load from a smart card** (desktop only), and provide the same password (and keyfile if used). In-app plans are automatically detected and displayed in a structured read-only viewer.

## 🏛️ Inheritance Planning Guide

Cryptocurrency has no "forgot password" recovery. If the holder dies without a plan, the assets are permanently lost. seQRets is designed to solve this problem.

### The Split Trust Model

The recommended approach creates **layered security with no single point of failure**:

| Layer | What | How |
|-------|------|-----|
| **1. Split the Secret** | Encrypt and split your seed phrase into Qards | Use the **Secure Secret** tab with a 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 threshold |
| **2. Write the Plan** | Create a clear instruction document for your heirs | Use the **Inheritance Plan** tab to encrypt a PDF/DOCX with recovery steps |
| **3. Distribute** | Give Qards to different trusted people/locations | No single person or location gets everything |

### Example: 2-of-3 Distribution

| Item | Location | Who Has Access |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Qard 1 | Home fireproof safe | Spouse |
| Qard 2 | Trusted family member | Sibling or adult child |
| Qard 3 | Bank safe deposit box | Named on the box |
| Encrypted Plan | With estate attorney | Attorney (sealed) |
| Password | Inside the encrypted plan only | No one — until decrypted |

> **Critical rule:** The password should NEVER be stored alongside the Qards. Include it only inside the encrypted inheritance plan document.

### What to Put in Your Inheritance Plan Document

The desktop app's **Create Plan** tab provides a structured form covering all of these sections. Alternatively, your encrypted instruction document should include:
- **Asset inventory** — list of wallets, exchanges, and holdings (not the secrets themselves)
- **Recovery instructions** — step-by-step guide for using seQRets to restore the secret
- **Qard locations** — where each Qard is physically stored and who holds it
- **Password** — safe to include here because the document is encrypted
- **Keyfile location** — if used, where the keyfile is stored
- **Exchange accounts** — exchange names, registered emails, and instructions to contact them with a death certificate
- **Hardware wallet locations** — physical devices, PINs, and access instructions
- **Professional contacts** — attorney, financial advisor, trusted technical friend

### Common Mistakes

- ❌ Storing seed phrases in a will (wills become public during probate)
- ❌ Telling no one your crypto exists
- ❌ Giving one person all Qards + the password
- ❌ Never testing the recovery process
- ❌ Forgetting to update after acquiring new assets or changing passwords

### Legal Considerations

> ⚠️ **seQRets is not a legal tool.** Consult a qualified estate planning attorney for wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and tax planning. seQRets handles the technical security layer — splitting and encrypting your secrets — but a complete estate plan requires legal documentation.

Key topics to discuss with your attorney:
- **Digital asset clauses** in your will or trust
- **Revocable living trusts** to avoid probate for crypto assets
- **Durable power of attorney** explicitly covering digital assets (for incapacity, not just death)
- **Tax implications** — inherited crypto may receive a stepped-up cost basis
