# seQRets: Crypto Inheritance That Actually Works

seQRets is a hyper-secure, open-source application designed to protect your most sensitive digital information — from crypto seed phrases and private keys to passwords and other confidential data. It uses **Shamir's Secret Sharing** to split your secret into multiple QR codes called **Qards**.

To restore your original secret, you must bring a specific number of these Qards back together. This eliminates the single point of failure associated with storing secrets in one location, providing a robust solution for personal backup and cryptocurrency inheritance planning.

> **Version 0.9.0 "Pyre"** — Available as a web app (Next.js) and native desktop app (Tauri + Vite).

## ⚠️ Warning

**Your security is your responsibility.** seQRets gives you full control over your digital assets. Misplacing your password or the required number of Qards can result in the **permanent loss** of your secret. The developers have no access to your data, cannot recover your password, and cannot restore your secrets. Manage your Qards and password with extreme care.

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Secure Your Secret
- Enter any text-based secret (seed phrases, private keys, passwords, etc.)
- Encrypt with a strong password (24+ characters required)
- Optionally add a **keyfile** as a second factor — both password AND keyfile are required for recovery
- Split into configurable Qards (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5 threshold)
- Download Qards as QR code images or export as a `.seqrets` vault file

### 🔓 Restore Your Secret
- **Drag & drop** QR code images from your file system
- **Upload** Qard image files (PNG, JPG)
- **Scan** QR codes with your camera (desktop and web)
- **Manual text entry** — paste raw share data
- **Import vault file** — load all shares at once from a `.seqrets` file
- Success sound plays on each accepted share

### 🛠️ Helper Tools
- **Password Generator** — cryptographically secure 32-character passwords (88-character charset)
- **Seed Phrase Generator** — generate valid BIP-39 mnemonic phrases
- **Bitcoin Ticker** — live BTC/USD price display
- **Bob AI Assistant** — Google Gemini-powered AI for setup guidance and questions (optional, user-provided API key)

### 🧬 BIP-39 Optimization
Seed phrases are automatically detected and converted to compact binary entropy before encryption. A 24-word phrase (~150 characters) becomes just 32 bytes, dramatically reducing QR code size.

## 🔐 Security Architecture

All cryptographic operations run **entirely on your device**. Your secrets never leave your machine.

| Layer | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Key Derivation** | Argon2id (64MB memory, 3 iterations) | Derive encryption key from password + optional keyfile |
| **Encryption** | XChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD) | Authenticated encryption with integrity verification |
| **Splitting** | Shamir's Secret Sharing | Threshold-based secret splitting into Qards |
| **Compression** | Gzip | Reduce payload size before encryption |
| **Memory** | Secure wipe | Overwrite sensitive data with random bytes after use |

**What gets split:** Only the fully encrypted data blob is split into shares — the raw secret is never split directly.

### ⚛️ Quantum Resistance

The built-in password generator produces passwords with ~10^62 possible combinations. Even with Grover's algorithm (optimal quantum speedup), brute-forcing would take:

- **Optimistic estimate:** ~2 × 10^18 years (148 million × the age of the universe)
- **Realistic estimate:** ~2 × 10^23 years (148 trillion × the age of the universe)

Argon2id's memory-hardness provides additional quantum resistance, and XChaCha20-Poly1305 maintains 128-bit effective quantum security as a defense-in-depth layer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Rust** (for desktop app only) — `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

### ⚙️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jalapeno4332/seQRets.git
cd seQRets
npm install
```

### 🌐 Run the Web App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002). All core features work offline — no API keys needed.

### 🖥️ Run the Desktop App

```bash
source ~/.cargo/env    # if Rust was just installed
npm run desktop:dev
```

### 📦 Build the Desktop Installer (.dmg)

```bash
npm run desktop:build
```

Produces `seQRets_0.9.0_aarch64.dmg` in `packages/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`.

### 🤖 Optional: Bob AI Assistant

Bob is an AI assistant that can answer questions about seQRets, Bitcoin security, and inheritance planning. It's entirely optional.

- **Web app:** Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env.local` file at the project root
- **Desktop app:** Click "Ask Bob" → follow the setup guide to enter your free Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

Your API key is stored locally and never sent to any server other than Google's Gemini API.

## 💡 How It Works

### 🔏 Encrypting a Secret

1. **Enter** your secret (seed phrase, private key, password, or any text)
2. **Secure** it with a strong password (and optional keyfile)
3. **Split** into your chosen Qard configuration (e.g., 2-of-3)
4. **Download** your Qards as QR images, a ZIP, or a `.seqrets` vault file

### 🔑 Restoring a Secret

1. **Add** the required number of Qards (drag-drop, upload, camera scan, or manual entry)
2. **Enter** your password (and keyfile if used during encryption)
3. **Restore** — your original secret is revealed
